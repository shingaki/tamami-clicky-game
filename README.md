Actor's Clicky Game

Created my first ReactJS application. The goal is to try to click on the actor's pictures 
without clicking on the same picture twice.

Here is a link to the game: https://tamami-clicky-game.herokuapp.com/

The areas of focus was:
- creating the Game page
- randomizing the pictures when someone clicked on an actor's image
- determining if the player already clicked on the picture and if not then add one to the score 
- if they have clicked on the actor's picture already then the points are taken away and the player must start the game over again.
